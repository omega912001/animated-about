# Anime.js Animation Project


### ***This project utilizes Anime.js, a lightweight JavaScript animation library, to create dynamic animations on web pages. The provided code snippet demonstrates how to use Anime.js to animate specific elements on an HTML page.***

 # Features
- Element Scaling: Animates the .home element, scaling it from 5 times its original size to its regular size over a duration of 6.5 seconds.
- Graph Animation: Animates the .graph element, translating it along the Y-axis from 50 pixels to its original position over a duration of 1.5 seconds.
-  Paragraph Rotation: Animates the .para element, rotating it by 720 degrees (2 full turns) in a linear motion over a duration of 1.1 seconds.
# How to Use
1. Include the Anime.js library in your HTML file:
```html
Copy code
<script src="anime.min.js"></script>
```
1. Add the provided JavaScript code to your project's script file.

2. Ensure that your HTML structure contains elements with the appropriate class names (`home`, `graph`, `para`) to target them with Anime.js.

3. Customize the animation properties (such as targets, duration, easing, etc.) according to your specific requirements.

# Examples
